# gpt-llama-intercommunication-gui

This script creates a graphical user interface (GUI) for an AI-based conversation application. The application allows users to interact with two language models: Llama and GPT-Neo. Users can type their input, and the application will generate responses using the selected language models.

Here's a breakdown of the script:

Importing Libraries: The script imports necessary libraries, including torch (PyTorch), transformers (Hugging Face Transformers), and tkinter (Python's standard GUI library).

Initializing Llama Model: The script initializes the Llama language model using the Llama class and the llama_generate function.

Initializing GPT-Neo Model: The script initializes the GPT-Neo language model using the GPTNeoForCausalLM class and the GPT2Tokenizer class from the transformers library.

Generate Response: The generate_response function generates responses based on user input. It uses the Llama model and/or the GPT-Neo model, depending on the user's selection.

GUI Setup: The script uses the tkinter library to create a GUI for the application. The GUI includes:

An input field for the user to type their message.
A text area to display the conversation history.
Checkboxes to select which language models to use (Llama and/or GPT-Neo).
A dynamic prompt entry field to provide a custom prompt.
Buttons to generate responses based on user input or the dynamic prompt.
Event Handlers: The script defines event handlers for button clicks and the Enter key press. These handlers call the generate_response function and update the GUI with the generated responses.

Main Loop: The script enters the tkinter main loop to start the GUI application.

Overall, this script provides an interactive way for users to communicate with language models and observe their responses in a conversation-like setting. The GUI allows users to choose between two language models (Llama and GPT-Neo) and provides options for custom prompts and dynamic interactions.
